# Clover Web App Team Take-Home Assignment

Using the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation), create an app that displays a list of 20 Rick and Morty characters where each list item contains basic information like the character's name, status, and species.

When a list item is clicked, the UI should update and display the character's image along with other details such as their location's name, type, dimension, and number of residents.

This assignment should be completed in about two days. If an extra day or two is needed, that's okay, just let us know.

The project should use React and be written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

Things we'll be looking at in your work are:

<ul>
  <li>Readability - How easy is it to understand your code at a glance?</li>
  <li>Maintainability - How easy will it be to work on this code months or even years from now?</li>
  <li>Extensibility - How easy will it be to add new features or make design tweaks?</li>
  <li>Accessibility - How have you structured your document to allow for basic accessibility?</li>
</ul>

Upload your completed project to Github and email your Contact at Clover a link to the repository.

Please provide a Readme along with your project with the following information:

<ul>
  <li>What architectural decisions did you make and why? Elaborate on strengths and weaknesses.</li>
  <li>How did you handle error cases? Eg: botched response, no response, etc.</li>
  <li>How did you test the app?</li>
  <li>What third party libraries/ external code snippets did you use, if any?</li>
  <li>If you had more time, what would you have done differently?</li>
</ul>

During the interview we may ask you to add a new feature to your project. We might even have another employee put up a pull request to your project and ask you to review it.

This is an opportunity for you to show off your skills! Make executive decisions. Take creative liberties. This is your projectâ€”you get to own it!

We eagerly look forward to seeing your work. Good luck!
